Design a scalable Cab finding system based on user and cab location. Given a list of cabs with their location, and userâ€™s current location, return a set of nearby cabs which lie within r km radius of the user.


Total users -> 50M
Active users -> 10M cab requests per day


// API END POINTS
searchCabs - search cabs in 1Km radius
updateCabLocation - cab info + current location
bookCabs - user location, userId
